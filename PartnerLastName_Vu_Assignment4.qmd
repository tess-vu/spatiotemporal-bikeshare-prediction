# Introduction

## The Rebalancing Challenge in Philadelphia

Philadelphia's Indego bike share system faces the same operational
challenge as every bike share system: **rebalancing bikes to meet
anticipated demand**.

Imagine you're an Indego operations manager at 6:00 AM on a Monday
morning. You have:

-   200 stations across Philadelphia

-   Limited trucks and staff for moving bikes

-   2-3 hours before morning rush hour demand peaks

-   **The question:** Which stations will run out of bikes by 8:30 AM?

This lab will teach you to build predictive models that forecast bike
share demand across **space** (different stations) and **time**
(different hours) to help solve this operational problem.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

1.  **Understand panel data structure** for space-time analysis
2.  **Create temporal lag variables** to capture demand persistence
3.  **Build multiple predictive models** with increasing complexity
4.  **Validate models temporally** (train on past, test on future)
5.  **Analyze prediction errors** in both space and time
6.  **Engineer new features** based on error patterns
7.  **Critically evaluate** when prediction errors matter most

## Assignment Structure

**Part 1 (In-Class/Together):**

-   Work through Q1 2025 data following this code

**Part 2 (HW5 - Teams of 2):**

-   Download a different quarter of Indego data (Q2, Q3, or Q4 2024)

-   Apply the same workflow to your quarter

-   Analyze error patterns in your quarter

-   Add 2-3 new features to improve the model

-   Write a brief report on what you learned

```

## Set Census API Key

```{r census_key, eval=FALSE}

census_api_key("YOUR_KEY_HERE", overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE)

```

```{r census_key_hidden, include=FALSE}
# Hidden key for rendering
census_api_key("YOUR_Key_Here", overwrite = TRUE)
```

# Data Import & Preparation

## Load Indego Trip Data (Q1 2025)

**Note for HW5:** You'll download a different quarter from:
https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/

```{r load_indego}
# Read Q1 2025 data
indego <- read_csv(here("data/indego-trips-2025-q1.csv"))

# Quick look at the data
glimpse(indego)
```

## Examine the Data Structure

```{r explore_data}
# How many trips?
cat("Total trips in Q1 2025:", nrow(indego), "\n")

# Date range
cat("Date range:", 
    min(mdy_hm(indego$start_time)), "to", 
    max(mdy_hm(indego$start_time)), "\n")

# How many unique stations?
cat("Unique start stations:", length(unique(indego$start_station)), "\n")

# Trip types
table(indego$trip_route_category)

# Passholder types
table(indego$passholder_type)

# Bike types
table(indego$bike_type)
```

## Create Time Bins

We need to aggregate trips into hourly intervals for our panel data
structure.

```{r create_time_bins}
indego <- indego %>%
  mutate(
    # Parse datetime
    start_datetime = mdy_hm(start_time),
    end_datetime = mdy_hm(end_time),
    
    # Create hourly bins
    interval60 = floor_date(start_datetime, unit = "hour"),
    
    # Extract time features
    week = week(interval60),
    month = month(interval60, label = TRUE),
    dotw = wday(interval60, label = TRUE),
    hour = hour(interval60),
    date = as.Date(interval60),
    
    # Create useful indicators
    weekend = ifelse(dotw %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), 1, 0),
    rush_hour = ifelse(hour %in% c(7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18), 1, 0)
  )

# Look at temporal features
head(indego %>% select(start_datetime, interval60, week, dotw, hour, weekend))
```

# Exploratory Analysis

## Trips Over Time

```{r trips_over_time}
# Daily trip counts
daily_trips <- indego %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(trips = n())

ggplot(daily_trips, aes(x = date, y = trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "#3182bd", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Indego Daily Ridership - Q1 2025",
    subtitle = "Winter demand patterns in Philadelphia",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Daily Trips",
    caption = "Source: Indego bike share"
  ) +
  plotTheme
```

**Question:** What patterns do you see? How does ridership change over
time?

Notice a big spike in Februrary of 2025 (the 14th - not just Valentine's
Day)? Was anybody in Philly last Feb? What closed everything and
cancelled my PPA class? ... Hint: Fly Eagles Fly

Let's investigate ... compare the 14th to all other Friday's in the data
... what did you find? Keep this in mind for future Feature Engineering.

```{r}
fly_eagles_fly <- daily_trips %>% filter(date == "2025-02-14")

typical_boring_friday <- indego %>%
  filter(dotw == "Fri", date != "2025-02-14") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(trips = n()) %>%
  summarize(avg_friday_trips = mean(trips))

print(fly_eagles_fly)
print(typical_boring_friday)

```

## Hourly Patterns

```{r hourly_patterns}
# Average trips by hour and day type
hourly_patterns <- indego %>%
  group_by(hour, weekend) %>%
  summarize(avg_trips = n() / n_distinct(date)) %>%
  mutate(day_type = ifelse(weekend == 1, "Weekend", "Weekday"))

ggplot(hourly_patterns, aes(x = hour, y = avg_trips, color = day_type)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Weekday" = "#08519c", "Weekend" = "#6baed6")) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Hourly Ridership Patterns",
    subtitle = "Clear commute patterns on weekdays",
    x = "Hour of Day",
    y = "Average Trips per Hour",
    color = "Day Type"
  ) +
  plotTheme
```

**Question:** When are the peak hours? How do weekends differ from
weekdays?

## Top Stations

```{r top_stations}
# Most popular origin stations
top_stations <- indego %>%
  count(start_station, start_lat, start_lon, name = "trips") %>%
  arrange(desc(trips)) %>%
  head(20)

kable(top_stations, 
      caption = "Top 20 Indego Stations by Trip Origins",
      format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

# Get Philadelphia Spatial Context

## Load Philadelphia Census Data

We'll get census tract data to add demographic context to our stations.

```{r load_census}
# Get Philadelphia census tracts
philly_census <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    "B01003_001",  # Total population
    "B19013_001",  # Median household income
    "B08301_001",  # Total commuters
    "B08301_010",  # Commute by transit
    "B02001_002",  # White alone
    "B25077_001"   # Median home value
  ),
  state = "PA",
  county = "Philadelphia",
  year = 2022,
  geometry = TRUE,
  output = "wide"
) %>%
  rename(
    Total_Pop = B01003_001E,
    Med_Inc = B19013_001E,
    Total_Commuters = B08301_001E,
    Transit_Commuters = B08301_010E,
    White_Pop = B02001_002E,
    Med_Home_Value = B25077_001E
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Percent_Taking_Transit = (Transit_Commuters / Total_Commuters) * 100,
    Percent_White = (White_Pop / Total_Pop) * 100
  ) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)  # WGS84 for lat/lon matching

# Check the data
glimpse(philly_census)
```

## Map Philadelphia Context

```{r map_philly}
# Map median income
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = philly_census, aes(fill = Med_Inc), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis(
    option = "viridis",
    name = "Median\nIncome",
    labels = scales::dollar
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Philadelphia Median Household Income by Census Tract",
    subtitle = "Context for understanding bike share demand patterns"
  ) +
  # Stations 
  geom_point(
    data = indego,
    aes(x = start_lon, y = start_lat),
    color = "red", size = 0.25, alpha = 0.6
  ) +
  mapTheme
```

## Join Census Data to Stations

We'll spatially join census characteristics to each bike station.

```{r join_census_to_stations}
# Create sf object for stations
stations_sf <- indego %>%
  distinct(start_station, start_lat, start_lon) %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_lat), !is.na(start_lon)) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("start_lon", "start_lat"), crs = 4326)

# Spatial join to get census tract for each station
stations_census <- st_join(stations_sf, philly_census, left = TRUE) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()

# Look at the result - investigate whether all of the stations joined to census data -- according to the map above there are stations in non-residential tracts.

stations_for_map <- indego %>%
  distinct(start_station, start_lat, start_lon) %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_lat), !is.na(start_lon)) %>%
  left_join(
    stations_census %>% select(start_station, Med_Inc),
    by = "start_station"
  ) %>%
  mutate(has_census = !is.na(Med_Inc))

# Add back to trip data
indego_census <- indego %>%
  left_join(
    stations_census %>% 
      select(start_station, Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, 
             Percent_White, Total_Pop),
    by = "start_station"
  )


# Prepare data for visualization
stations_for_map <- indego %>%
  distinct(start_station, start_lat, start_lon) %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_lat), !is.na(start_lon)) %>%
  left_join(
    stations_census %>% select(start_station, Med_Inc),
    by = "start_station"
  ) %>%
  mutate(has_census = !is.na(Med_Inc))

# Create the map showing problem stations
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = philly_census, aes(fill = Med_Inc), color = "white", size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_viridis(
    option = "viridis",
    name = "Median\nIncome",
    labels = scales::dollar,
    na.value = "grey90"
  ) +
  # Stations with census data (small grey dots)
  geom_point(
    data = stations_for_map %>% filter(has_census),
    aes(x = start_lon, y = start_lat),
    color = "grey30", size = 1, alpha = 0.6
  ) +
  # Stations WITHOUT census data (red X marks the spot)
  geom_point(
    data = stations_for_map %>% filter(!has_census),
    aes(x = start_lon, y = start_lat),
    color = "red", size = 1, shape = 4, stroke = 1.5
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Philadelphia Median Household Income by Census Tract",
    subtitle = "Indego stations shown (RED = no census data match)",
    caption = "Red X marks indicate stations that didn't join to census tracts"
  ) +
  mapTheme



```

# Dealing with missing data

We need to decide what to do with the non-residential bike share
stations. For this example, we are going to remove them—this is not
necessarily the right way to do things always, but for the sake of
simplicity, we are narrowing our scope to only stations in residential
neighborhoods. We might opt to create a separate model for
non-residential stations.

```{r}
# Identify which stations to keep
valid_stations <- stations_census %>%
  filter(!is.na(Med_Inc)) %>%
  pull(start_station)

# Filter trip data to valid stations only
indego_census <- indego %>%
  filter(start_station %in% valid_stations) %>%
  left_join(
    stations_census %>% 
      select(start_station, Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, 
             Percent_White, Total_Pop),
    by = "start_station"
  )

```

# Get Weather Data

Weather significantly affects bike share demand! Let's get hourly
weather for Philadelphia.

```{r get_weather}
# Get weather from Philadelphia International Airport (KPHL)
# This covers Q1 2025: January 1 - March 31
weather_data <- riem_measures(
  station = "PHL",  # Philadelphia International Airport
  date_start = "2025-01-01",
  date_end = "2025-03-31"
)

# Process weather data
weather_processed <- weather_data %>%
  mutate(
    interval60 = floor_date(valid, unit = "hour"),
    Temperature = tmpf,  # Temperature in Fahrenheit
    Precipitation = ifelse(is.na(p01i), 0, p01i),  # Hourly precip in inches
    Wind_Speed = sknt  # Wind speed in knots
  ) %>%
  select(interval60, Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed) %>%
  distinct()

# Check for missing hours and interpolate if needed
weather_complete <- weather_processed %>%
  complete(interval60 = seq(min(interval60), max(interval60), by = "hour")) %>%
  fill(Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed, .direction = "down")

# Look at the weather
summary(weather_complete %>% select(Temperature, Precipitation, Wind_Speed))
```

## Visualize Weather Patterns

Who is ready for a Philly winter?!

```{r visualize_weather}
ggplot(weather_complete, aes(x = interval60, y = Temperature)) +
  geom_line(color = "#3182bd", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Philadelphia Temperature - Q1 2025",
    subtitle = "Winter to early spring transition",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Temperature (°F)"
  ) +
  plotTheme
```

# Create Space-Time Panel

## Aggregate Trips to Station-Hour Level

```{r aggregate_trips}
# Count trips by station-hour
trips_panel <- indego_census %>%
  group_by(interval60, start_station, start_lat, start_lon,
           Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, Percent_White, Total_Pop) %>%
  summarize(Trip_Count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

# How many station-hour observations?
nrow(trips_panel)

# How many unique stations?
length(unique(trips_panel$start_station))

# How many unique hours?
length(unique(trips_panel$interval60))
```

## Create Complete Panel Structure

Not every station has trips every hour. We need a **complete panel**
where every station-hour combination exists (even if Trip_Count = 0).

```{r complete_panel}
# Calculate expected panel size
n_stations <- length(unique(trips_panel$start_station))
n_hours <- length(unique(trips_panel$interval60))
expected_rows <- n_stations * n_hours

cat("Expected panel rows:", format(expected_rows, big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("Current rows:", format(nrow(trips_panel), big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("Missing rows:", format(expected_rows - nrow(trips_panel), big.mark = ","), "\n")

# Create complete panel
study_panel <- expand.grid(
  interval60 = unique(trips_panel$interval60),
  start_station = unique(trips_panel$start_station)
) %>%
  # Join trip counts
  left_join(trips_panel, by = c("interval60", "start_station")) %>%
  # Replace NA trip counts with 0
  mutate(Trip_Count = replace_na(Trip_Count, 0))

# Fill in station attributes (they're the same for all hours)
station_attributes <- trips_panel %>%
  group_by(start_station) %>%
  summarize(
    start_lat = first(start_lat),
    start_lon = first(start_lon),
    Med_Inc = first(Med_Inc),
    Percent_Taking_Transit = first(Percent_Taking_Transit),
    Percent_White = first(Percent_White),
    Total_Pop = first(Total_Pop)
  )

study_panel <- study_panel %>%
  left_join(station_attributes, by = "start_station")

# Verify we have complete panel
cat("Complete panel rows:", format(nrow(study_panel), big.mark = ","), "\n")
```

## Add Time Features

```{r add_time_features}
study_panel <- study_panel %>%
  mutate(
    week = week(interval60),
    month = month(interval60, label = TRUE),
    dotw = wday(interval60, label = TRUE),
    hour = hour(interval60),
    date = as.Date(interval60),
    weekend = ifelse(dotw %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), 1, 0),
    rush_hour = ifelse(hour %in% c(7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18), 1, 0)
  )
```

## Join Weather Data

```{r join_weather}
study_panel <- study_panel %>%
  left_join(weather_complete, by = "interval60")

# Check for missing values
summary(study_panel %>% select(Trip_Count, Temperature, Precipitation))
```

# Create Temporal Lag Variables

The key innovation for space-time prediction: **past demand predicts
future demand**.

## Why Lags?

If there were 15 bike trips from Station A at 8:00 AM, there will
probably be \~15 trips at 9:00 AM. We can use this temporal persistence
to improve predictions.

```{r create_lags}
# Sort by station and time
study_panel <- study_panel %>%
  arrange(start_station, interval60)

# Create lag variables WITHIN each station
study_panel <- study_panel %>%
  group_by(start_station) %>%
  mutate(
    lag1Hour = lag(Trip_Count, 1),
    lag2Hours = lag(Trip_Count, 2),
    lag3Hours = lag(Trip_Count, 3),
    lag12Hours = lag(Trip_Count, 12),
    lag1day = lag(Trip_Count, 24)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Remove rows with NA lags (first 24 hours for each station)
study_panel_complete <- study_panel %>%
  filter(!is.na(lag1day))

cat("Rows after removing NA lags:", format(nrow(study_panel_complete), big.mark = ","), "\n")
```

## Visualize Lag Correlations

```{r lag_correlations}
# Sample one station to visualize
example_station <- study_panel_complete %>%
  filter(start_station == first(start_station)) %>%
  head(168)  # One week

# Plot actual vs lagged demand
ggplot(example_station, aes(x = interval60)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Trip_Count, color = "Current"), linewidth = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = lag1Hour, color = "1 Hour Ago"), linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = lag1day, color = "24 Hours Ago"), linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Current" = "#08519c",
    "1 Hour Ago" = "#3182bd",
    "24 Hours Ago" = "#6baed6"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Temporal Lag Patterns at One Station",
    subtitle = "Past demand predicts future demand",
    x = "Date-Time",
    y = "Trip Count",
    color = "Time Period"
  ) +
  plotTheme
```

# Temporal Train/Test Split

**CRITICAL:** We must train on PAST data and test on FUTURE data!

## Why Temporal Validation Matters

In real operations, at 6:00 AM on March 15, we need to predict demand
for March 15-31. We have data from Jan 1 - March 14, but NOT from March
15-31 (it hasn't happened yet!).

**Wrong approach:** Train on weeks 10-13, test on weeks 1-9 (predicting
past from future!)

**Correct approach:** Train on weeks 1-9, test on weeks 10-13
(predicting future from past)

```{r temporal_split}
# Split by week
# Q1 has weeks 1-13 (Jan-Mar)
# Train on weeks 1-9 (Jan 1 - early March)
# Test on weeks 10-13 (rest of March)

# Which stations have trips in BOTH early and late periods?
early_stations <- study_panel_complete %>%
  filter(week < 10) %>%
  filter(Trip_Count > 0) %>%
  distinct(start_station) %>%
  pull(start_station)

late_stations <- study_panel_complete %>%
  filter(week >= 10) %>%
  filter(Trip_Count > 0) %>%
  distinct(start_station) %>%
  pull(start_station)

# Keep only stations that appear in BOTH periods
common_stations <- intersect(early_stations, late_stations)


# Filter panel to only common stations
study_panel_complete <- study_panel_complete %>%
  filter(start_station %in% common_stations)

# NOW create train/test split
train <- study_panel_complete %>%
  filter(week < 10)

test <- study_panel_complete %>%
  filter(week >= 10)

cat("Training observations:", format(nrow(train), big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("Testing observations:", format(nrow(test), big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("Training date range:", min(train$date), "to", max(train$date), "\n")
cat("Testing date range:", min(test$date), "to", max(test$date), "\n")






```

# Build Predictive Models

We'll build 5 models with increasing complexity to see what improves
predictions.

## Model 1: Baseline (Time + Weather)

```{r model1}

# Create day of week factor with treatment (dummy) coding
train <- train %>%
  mutate(dotw_simple = factor(dotw, levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")))

# Set contrasts to treatment coding (dummy variables)
contrasts(train$dotw_simple) <- contr.treatment(7)

# Now run the model
model1 <- lm(
  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation,
  data = train
)

summary(model1)
```

The model uses Monday as the baseline. Each coefficient represents the
difference in expected trips per station-hour compared to
Monday—dow_simple2 = Tuesday.

**Weekday Pattern (Tue-Fri):**

-   All weekdays have positive coefficients (0.029 to 0.052)
-   Tuesday has the highest weekday effect (+0.052)
-   Weekdays likely benefit from concentrated commuting patterns

**Weekend Pattern (Sat-Sun):**

-   Both weekend days have negative coefficients (-0.061 and -0.065)
-   This means FEWER trips per station-hour than Monday

**Hourly Interpretation**

Hour Coefficient Interpretation 0 (baseline) 0.000 trips/hour (midnight)
1 -0.018 slightly fewer than midnight ... 6 +0.151 morning activity
starting 7 +0.276 morning rush building 8 +0.487 PEAK morning rush 9
+0.350 post-rush ... 17 +0.568 PEAK evening rush (5 PM!) 18 +0.389
evening declining ... 23 +0.034 late night minimal

Isn't this fun!

## Model 2: Add Temporal Lags

```{r model2}
model2 <- lm(
  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +
    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day,
  data = train
)

summary(model2)
```

**Question:** Did adding lags improve R²? Why or why not?

## Model 3: Add Demographics

```{r model3}
model3 <- lm(
  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +
    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day +
    Med_Inc.x + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y,
  data = train
)

summary(model3)
```

## Model 4: Add Station Fixed Effects

```{r model4}
model4 <- lm(
  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +
    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day +
    Med_Inc.x + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y +
    as.factor(start_station),
  data = train
)

# Summary too long with all station dummies, just show key metrics
cat("Model 4 R-squared:", summary(model4)$r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 4 Adj R-squared:", summary(model4)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
```

**What do station fixed effects capture?** Baseline differences in
demand across stations (some are just busier than others!).

## Model 5: Add Rush Hour Interaction

```{r model5}
model5 <- lm(
  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +
    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day + rush_hour + as.factor(month) +
    Med_Inc.x + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y +
    as.factor(start_station) +
    rush_hour * weekend,  # Rush hour effects different on weekends
  data = train
)

cat("Model 5 R-squared:", summary(model5)$r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 5 Adj R-squared:", summary(model5)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
```

# Model Evaluation

## Calculate Predictions and MAE

```{r calculate_mae}
# Get predictions on test set

# Create day of week factor with treatment (dummy) coding
test <- test %>%
  mutate(dotw_simple = factor(dotw, levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")))

# Set contrasts to treatment coding (dummy variables)
contrasts(test$dotw_simple) <- contr.treatment(7)

test <- test %>%
  mutate(

    mean(abs(test$Trip_Count - test$pred4), na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(abs(test$Trip_Count - test$pred5), na.rm = TRUE)
  )
)

kable(mae_results, 
      digits = 2,
      caption = "Mean Absolute Error by Model (Test Set)",
      col.names = c("Model", "MAE (trips)")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

## Visualize Model Comparison

```{r compare_models}
ggplot(mae_results, aes(x = reorder(Model, -MAE), y = MAE)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#3182bd", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(MAE, 2)), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(

    x = "Model",
    y = "Mean Absolute Error (trips)"
  ) +
  plotTheme +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

**Question:** Which features gave us the biggest improvement?

# Space-Time Error Analysis

## Observed vs. Predicted

Let's use our best model (Model 2) for error analysis.

```{r obs_vs_pred}
test <- test %>%
  mutate(
    error = Trip_Count - pred2,
    abs_error = abs(error),
    time_of_day = case_when(
      hour < 7 ~ "Overnight",
      hour >= 7 & hour < 10 ~ "AM Rush",
      hour >= 10 & hour < 15 ~ "Mid-Day",
      hour >= 15 & hour <= 18 ~ "PM Rush",
      hour > 18 ~ "Evening"
    )
  )

# Scatter plot by time and day type
ggplot(test, aes(x = Trip_Count, y = pred2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, color = "#3182bd") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkgreen") +
  facet_grid(weekend ~ time_of_day) +
  labs(
    title = "Observed vs. Predicted Bike Trips",
    subtitle = "Model 2 performance by time period",
    x = "Observed Trips",
    y = "Predicted Trips",
    caption = "Red line = perfect predictions; Green line = actual model fit"
  ) +
  plotTheme
```

**Question:** Where is the model performing well? Where is it
struggling?

## Spatial Error Patterns

Are prediction errors clustered in certain parts of Philadelphia?

```{r spatial_errors}
# Calculate MAE by station
station_errors <- test %>%
  group_by(start_station, start_lat.x, start_lon.y) %>%
  summarize(
    MAE = mean(abs_error, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_demand = mean(Trip_Count, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_lat.x), !is.na(start_lon.y))

## Create Two Maps Side-by-Side with Proper Legends (sorry these maps are ugly)

# Calculate station errors
station_errors <- test %>%

**Question:** Do you see spatial clustering of errors? What
neighborhoods have high errors?

## Temporal Error Patterns

When are we most wrong?

```{r temporal_errors}
# MAE by time of day and day type
temporal_errors <- test %>%
  group_by(time_of_day, weekend) %>%
  summarize(
    MAE = mean(abs_error, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(day_type = ifelse(weekend == 1, "Weekend", "Weekday"))

ggplot(temporal_errors, aes(x = time_of_day, y = MAE, fill = day_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Weekday" = "#08519c", "Weekend" = "#6baed6")) +
  labs(
    title = "Prediction Errors by Time Period",
    subtitle = "When is the model struggling most?",
    x = "Time of Day",
    y = "Mean Absolute Error (trips)",
    fill = "Day Type"
  ) +
  plotTheme +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Errors and Demographics

Are prediction errors related to neighborhood characteristics?

```{r errors_demographics}
# Join demographic data to station errors
station_errors_demo <- station_errors %>%
  left_join(
    station_attributes %>% select(start_station, Med_Inc, Percent_Taking_Transit, Percent_White),
    by = "start_station"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Med_Inc))

# Create plots
p1 <- ggplot(station_errors_demo, aes(x = Med_Inc, y = MAE)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "#3182bd") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Errors vs. Median Income", x = "Median Income", y = "MAE") +
  plotTheme

p2 <- ggplot(station_errors_demo, aes(x = Percent_Taking_Transit, y = MAE)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "#3182bd") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Errors vs. Transit Usage", x = "% Taking Transit", y = "MAE") +
  plotTheme

p3 <- ggplot(station_errors_demo, aes(x = Percent_White, y = MAE)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "#3182bd") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Errors vs. Race", x = "% White", y = "MAE") +
  plotTheme

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2)
```

**Critical Question:** Are prediction errors systematically higher in
certain demographic groups? What are the equity implications?

# HW5: Your Turn!

For Homework 5, you'll work either all byyyy yourself or in teams of 2
to:

## Part 1: Replicate with Different Quarter (alternately, you could do a longer time-span by merging multiple quarters together. I'm not picky about that)

1.  **Download data** for Q2, Q3, or Q4 2024 from:
    https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/

2.  **Adapt this code** to work with your quarter:

    -   Update date ranges for weather data
    -   Check for any data structure changes
    -   Create the same 5 models
    -   Calculate MAE for each model

3.  **Compare results** to Q1 2025:

    -   How do MAE values compare? Why might they differ?
    -   Are temporal patterns different (e.g., summer vs. winter)?
    -   Which features are most important in your quarter?

## Part 2: Error Analysis

Analyze your model's errors in detail:

1.  **Spatial patterns:**

    -   Create error maps
    -   Identify neighborhoods with high errors
    -   Hypothesize why (missing features? different demand patterns?)

2.  **Temporal patterns:**

    -   When are errors highest?
    -   Do certain hours/days have systematic under/over-prediction?
    -   Are there seasonal patterns?

3.  **Demographic patterns:**

    -   Relate errors to census characteristics
    -   Are certain communities systematically harder to predict?
    -   What are the equity implications?

## Part 3: Feature Engineering & model improvement

Based on your error analysis, add 2-3 NEW features to improve the model:

**Potential features to consider:**

*Temporal features:*

-   Holiday indicators (Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day)
-   School calendar (Penn, Drexel, Temple in session?)
-   Special events (concerts, sports games, conventions)
-   Day of month (payday effects?)

*Weather features:*

-   Feels-like temperature (wind chill/heat index)
-   "Perfect biking weather" indicator (60-75°F, no rain)
-   Precipitation forecast (not just current)
-   Weekend + nice weather interaction

*Spatial features:*

-   Distance to Center City
-   Distance to nearest university
-   Distance to nearest park
-   Points of interest nearby (restaurants, offices, bars)
-   Station capacity
-   Bike lane connectivity

*Trip history features:*

-   Rolling 7-day average demand
-   Same hour last week
-   Station "type" clustering (residential, commercial, tourist)

**Implementation:**

-   Add your features to the best model
-   Compare MAE before and after
-   Explain *why* you chose these features
-   Did they improve predictions? Where?

**Try a poisson model for count data**

-   Does this improve model fit?

## Part 4: Critical Reflection

Write 1-2 paragraphs addressing:

1.  **Operational implications:**
    -   Is your final MAE "good enough" for Indego to use?
    -   When do prediction errors cause problems for rebalancing?
    -   Would you recommend deploying this system? Under what
        conditions?
2.  **Equity considerations:**
    -   Do prediction errors disproportionately affect certain
        neighborhoods?
    -   Could this system worsen existing disparities in bike access?
    -   What safeguards would you recommend?
3.  **Model limitations:**
    -   What patterns is your model missing?
    -   What assumptions might not hold in real deployment?
    -   How would you improve this with more time/data?

# Submission Requirements

## What to Submit (per team)

1.  **Rmd file** with all your code (commented!)

2.  **HTML output** with results and visualizations

3.  **Brief report** summarizing (with supporting data & visualization):

    -   Your quarter and why you chose it
    -   Model comparison results
    -   Error analysis insights
    -   New features you added and why
    -   Critical reflection on deployment

## Tips for Success

1.  **Start early** - data download and processing takes time
2.  **Work together** - pair programming is your friend
3.  **Test incrementally** - don't wait until the end to run code
4.  **Document everything** - explain your choices
5.  **Be creative** - the best features come from understanding Philly!
6.  **Think critically** - technical sophistication isn't enough
